# Introduction 

The Active Directory lab is focused on detecting unauthorized user activity. It includes creating alerts in Splunk, and integrating Slack and Shuffle for automated detection and response. The lab is deployed on the [Vultr cloud platform](https://www.vultr.com/) , providing a scalable and realistic environment for hands-on cybersecurity training.
I will be using this labs to get hands on skills learning splunk and shuffle, as i have never used any of these platforms before.
